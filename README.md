        - 1. An interactive dashboard was built using Pivot Tables and KPIs to effectively analyze and visualize Dengue patient data.

        - 2. Power Query was used to clean, structure, and transform raw health records, enabling dynamic filtering and real-time insights.

        - 3. 97% of positive cases were detected at an early stage, significantly improving the chances of successful treatment.

        - 4. Females and adults aged 30 to 50 were identified as the most affected demographic group.

        - 5. The areas of Jatrabari and Demra showed the highest Dengue positivity rates, with underdeveloped zones experiencing a higher infection ratio compared to more developed regions.

        - 6. Dengue check-up rates were significantly higher among residents living in buildings, suggesting greater health awareness or access to medical services.

        - 7. In contrast, individuals living in tinshed or informal housing showed lower check-up rates, yet exhibited a higher rate of Dengue infection, indicating a lack of early detection and health engagement in underprivileged areas.


# üìå Action Plan (Recommendations):

##1. Targeted Awareness Campaigns:
        Launch localized Dengue awareness programs in underdeveloped areas such as Jatrabari and Demra, focusing on early symptom recognition, hygiene practices, and the importance of timely check-ups.

##2. Mobile Health Clinics in Vulnerable Areas:
        Deploy mobile check-up units or community screening camps in tinshed and informal housing zones to improve access to medical testing and encourage early diagnosis.

##3. Focused Interventions for High-Risk Demographics:
        Initiate health education and prevention programs targeted at females and adults aged 30‚Äì50, the most affected demographic group according to the data.

##4. Community Health Ambassadors:
        Train residents in buildings or formal housing ‚Äî who already show higher check-up rates ‚Äî to act as peer educators and outreach volunteers for nearby informal settlements.

##5. Public-Private Collaboration for Resource Distribution:
        Work with local governments, health departments, and NGOs to provide mosquito nets, repellents, and organize environmental cleanup drives in high-risk neighborhoods.

##6. Digital Health Communication:
        Use SMS campaigns, WhatsApp groups, and social media to disseminate real-time Dengue alerts, health tips, and testing center locations, ensuring wide outreach in urban areas.
